# Icarus Diary

Icarus Diary is a local-first diary backed by a plain `.ics` file. On desktop,
you choose a data folder. Icarus keeps `diary.ics`, `drafts.json`, and
`settings.json` in that folder, including when it is on removable media. It
does not remember the folder on the host: choose it again after relaunching.
No account, server, or sync service is required.

The same frontend runs in a plain browser too: the app detects the runtime and
swaps the storage backend (the selected folder via Tauri, IndexedDB in the
browser). Browser mode stores a copy of imported diaries in the browser profile;
use the desktop app when you want control over the data folder.

Built with Tauri 2, Svelte 5, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Capabilities

- Calendar month view with multiple entries per day, a Markdown editor and
  reader, locations, editing, deletion, and undo.
- Local fuzzy search across titles, locations, and entry bodies with
  `Ctrl/Cmd + K`.
- Desktop folder selection, `.ics` import into that folder, and backup export.
- Drafts and preferences persisted beside `diary.ics` on desktop.
- Atomic `.ics` writes on desktop, so a failed save does not replace the
  original file; browser vaults live in IndexedDB and export as `.ics`.
- A private desktop WebView session to avoid retaining browser profile data
  between launches.
- On Linux, GTK and WebKit runtime data uses a private directory in `/dev/shm`
  that is removed on a normal exit. This also keeps chosen paths out of GTK's
  persistent recent-files history. The app requires `/dev/shm` to be available.

## Desktop data and privacy

Choose an existing Icarus folder to open its `diary.ics`, or choose an empty
folder to create one. To bring in an older `.ics`, choose **Import .ics** and
then an empty destination folder. Import copies the entries into that folder's
`diary.ics`; it leaves the original file alone. Icarus will not overwrite an
existing `diary.ics` during import. Backup export also requires a new filename,
so it cannot overwrite an older backup. Keep the chosen folder connected while
editing; failed saves leave the current entry or draft open for retry.

Earlier desktop versions stored `drafts.json` and `settings.json` in Tauri's
application data directory. This release does not read or delete those legacy
files automatically. If you used an earlier version, close Icarus and copy any
legacy `drafts.json` and `settings.json` that belong to this diary into the
chosen folder **before opening it**, provided files with those names are not
already there. The old `icsPath` setting is ignored. Once you have checked the
diary and drafts, you can remove the legacy files from the application's old
data directory. Deleting files does not guarantee physical erasure of earlier
disk contents. The operating system can also write process memory to swap or
hibernation storage; choosing an external folder does not control that behavior.

## Development

Requires Node.js, pnpm, Rust 1.98.1 (pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`), and the
Linux WebKitGTK 4.1/GTK3 development libraries for Linux desktop builds.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev       # desktop development with hot reload
pnpm dev             # browser mode on port 1420 (IndexedDB storage)
pnpm dev:seed        # browser mode with an in-memory sample diary
pnpm test            # Vitest unit tests
pnpm test:e2e        # browser-mode end-to-end tests (Playwright)
pnpm check           # svelte-check and TypeScript
pnpm tauri:build     # desktop bundle
```

`pnpm dev:seed` opens a deterministic sample diary (about three years of
entries, with gaps and multi-entry days) on an in-memory storage backend:
edits, drafts and settings are discarded on reload, and the real browser vault
is never read or written. Set `VITE_SEED_YEARS` for a longer history, e.g.
`VITE_SEED_YEARS=20 pnpm dev:seed`.

The E2E suite drives the real UI in Chromium. It needs the browser once
(`pnpm exec playwright install chromium`) and serves the app itself. It runs
against a non-loopback HTTP origin on purpose — browsers only expose
secure-context APIs like `crypto.randomUUID` over HTTPS or localhost, and the
browser backend has to keep working on plain-HTTP LAN addresses. Set
`ICARUS_E2E_HOST` to choose the address the dev server should bind.

The data mapping is implemented in [`src/lib/ical.ts`](src/lib/ical.ts), and
the pluggable storage backends are in
[`src/lib/storage/`](src/lib/storage/).
